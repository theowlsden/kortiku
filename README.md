## **Short Description**

> Simple and minimalistic URL shortener web application that lets you short multiple URLs. Besides that it allows you to create a link-in-profile where you can share multiple URLs in one link.

## **Problem Description**

In this day and age, people are sharing a lot of URLs with each other. This comes with the added issue of sharing long URLs that are too long and complex or that you would have to share multiple separate URLs increasing the URL confusion that already exists.

## **Solution**

A URL shortener allows you to create alias URLs that are shortened and more readable. By creating a collection of URLs and giving them a description, it becomes easier to share URLs. That is what Kortiku offers. While you can share the alias URLs, Kortiku also allows for the creation of QR codes for easy sharing.
